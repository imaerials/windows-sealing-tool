# Powershell Windows Sealing Tool 
Some of my efforts to reduce human errors while sealing Windows Master Images in a company. This Tool will allow the admin to set the modifications in a config file that then can be loaded depending each single VM image. 
It will maitain consistency and keep a log of every action performed.
